Create a sample application having Register and login functionality and basic CRUD functionality on User list. You can keep the user list in local storage. 

So the flow is like,
    1. User opens the website and see login page with registration link below it.
    2. When user click on registration he/she can see a new page with email, pass and confirm pass fields. They can sign up using email and pass.
    3. When sign up is done you need to add new entry in users array in local storage. The same array you can use to validate the user on login.
    4. Once user successfully logged in, he/she can see a landing page with all users which are registered. Again same array of users from local storage you can use here.
    5. Logged in user can edit any other user details like First name, Last name, Mobile, Address etc. except email and password. Keep a separate page for edit user so you can use route there.
    6. Logged in user can delete any other user as well.

You can add your imagination to add more features around the mentioned one.
