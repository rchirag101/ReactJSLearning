// endNote : we used all those core features and building blocks that are important for React. Components, props, state with the use State Hook, lifting state up and all of these things. 
// We used styling. We passed functions between the different components. 
// So all these core patterns and concepts which you basically need for every React application you're going to build, we have them all in here. And that's why this hopefully, was a great practice project
